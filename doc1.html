            <span class="span_" >About HPV</span>
            <p>
              Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common virus that 8 in 10 people will get. It usually goes away without causing any problems.</br>
              <span class="span_" >What is HPV?</span></br>
              HPV is the name of a common virus. It infects the skin and any moist membrane (mucosa), such as:
              the cervix 
              the lining of the mouth and throat
              the vagina, vulva and anus (back passage). 
              HPV is usually passed on through sexual contact, which can make some people feel worried or embarrassed. But it is nothing to be ashamed of. Because HPV lives on our skin, it is easy to get and difficult to completely protect against. At some point during our lives, 8 in 10 men and women will get HPV. In most cases, your immune system will get rid of HPV without it causing any problems.</br>  
              <span class="span_">Types of HPV</span></br>
              We know of over 200 types of HPV. Each type has a number and different types affect different parts of the body. 
              HPV types are usually split into:
              low-risk HPV
              high-risk HPV
              Low-risk HPV may not cause any problems or cause minor conditions like warts on your hands and feet, and genital warts. Most HPV types are low risk. 
              High-risk HPV is linked to some cancers. It is important to remember that if you have any type of HPV, including high-risk HPV, your body will usually get rid of it without any problems.
            
              Genital HPV 
              About 40 HPV types affect the genital areas of men and women, including the:
              cervix
              anus
              vagina
              skin of the penis
              vulva and perianal skin (area outside the vagina, including the labia and the area between the opening of the vagina and anus).
              HPV and cancer
              About 13 HPV types are linked to cancer. These types are called high-risk HPV. 
              Having high-risk HPV does not mean you will get cancer. Like other HPV types, in most people high-risk HPV goes away without causing any problems. 
              HPV symptoms 
              HPV has no symptoms, which means that many people may have had HPV without knowing. This can sound worrying, but remember that HPV usually goes away by itself, without causing any problems. 
              HPV treatment
              There is no treatment for HPV itself. But there are treatments for conditions caused by HPV, including genital warts, cervical cell changes and cancer.

            <p><span class="span_">HPV and genital warts</span>
              Genital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Genital warts can be treated. 
              What are genital warts?
              Genital warts are small growths on the skin. They can be small, single warts, which may look like a change or different colour on the skin. Or they sometimes appear in small clusters of several warts, which looks like a small cauliflower. 
              Both women and men can be affected by genital warts. In women, they can affect the skin of the:
              upper thighs or skin around the genital area
              vulva, which is the external genital area that includes the labia and the clitoris
              vagina
              cervix 
              anus, around the opening and inside.
              In men, genital warts can affect the skin of the: 
              upper thighs or skin around the genital area
              penis, outside and inside the urethra, which is where urine comes out
              scrotum, which is the skin covering testicles
              anus, around the opening and inside.
              Genital warts should not cause any pain or serious problems. But they can be unpleasant and may upset or worry people. If the warts affect the skin around the penis, vagina or anus, they sometimes cause bleeding in that area. 
              If you think that you have genital warts, it is important to visit your doctor. They will be able to diagnose and treat the infection.
              How do people get genital warts?
              Genital warts are caused by HPV. HPV is a common virus that is passed on through skin-to-skin contact, including:
              vaginal sex
              anal sex
              oral sex
              Although less likely, HPV can also be passed on by:
              touching in the genital area
              sharing sex toys. 
              The type of HPV that causes genital warts is called low-risk HPV. This means that the HPV sometimes causes unpleasant but harmless conditions, like genital warts, but nothing more serious. Low-risk HPV is not linked to cancer.

              Treating genital warts 
              Genital warts are usually treated in 2 different ways:
              Creams and liquids
              Sometimes a cream or liquid is applied directly to the warts to help get rid of it. This is also called topical treatment. 
              There are several types of topical treatments. These attack the cells of the warts, or encourage your immune system to recognise and attack the warts. Topical treatments are usually given for softer warts. 
              Removing the warts 
              Warts can be destroyed or removed by:
              freezing them (cryotherapy) 
              removing them with surgery (physical ablation).
              Sometimes both types of treatment are used one after the other. People may need several rounds of treatment to get rid of genital warts completely.
              Pregnancy and genital warts
              If you are pregnant and have a history of genital warts, it is important to let your midwife know. During pregnancy, warts may get bigger or there may be more of them. Any warts are usually treated with cryotherapy.
              There is a small risk of passing on the infection during a vaginal birth, but this is rare. If the infection is passed on, the warts usually appear in the child’s mouth. They are treated with cream or by removing them. Your doctor or midwife can give you more information.
              Very rarely, large genital warts may appear on the cervix or block the birth canal. If this happens, the doctor may suggest a C-section (Caesarean delivery) but this is rare. 
              Genital warts FAQs
              If I've had genital warts, am I more likely to develop cervical cancer?
              No. Cervical cancer is usually caused by different types of HPV, called high-risk HPV. The HPV types that cause genital warts are called low risk because they are not linked to cancer
              Does the HPV vaccine protect against genital warts?
              The HPV vaccine given is schools and privately protects against HPV 6 and 11, which cause about 9 in 10 cases of genital warts. 
              Can I completely protect against genital warts?
              Genital warts are caused by HPV. You can’t fully protect against HPV because it lives on the skin. But there are some ways to reduce your risk of getting HPV, including:
              having the HPV vaccine, which protects against 9 in 10 cases of genital warts
              having safer sex, using a condom or dental dam – although this doesn’t fully protect you, as it only covers part of the skin.

              <p><span >How people get HPV </span >
                HPV is a common virus that people usually get through skin-to-skin contact. In 9 in 10 people, the immune system gets rid of the virus within 2 years.
                How do people get HPV?
                People usually get HPV through skin-to-skin contact. For the types of HPV that affect the genitals, this includes:
                vaginal sex
                anal sex
                oral sex.
                Although it is rarer, HPV can also be passed on through:
                touching in the genital area
                sharing sex toys. 
                Am I at risk of getting HPV?
                About 8 in 10 men and women will get HPV at some point in their life. If you have ever had any kind of sexual contact, you may have HPV. Sexual contact includes all the ways of getting HPV we mention above, not just penetrative sex. 
                Reducing your risk of HPV
                You can’t completely protect against HPV. But there are ways you can reduce your risk of getting HPV or developing a persistent infection that your immune system can’t get rid of:
                Try to stop smoking
                About 2 in 10 cervical cancers are linked to smoking tobacco. Smoking can make your immune system weaker, which means it is less likely to protect against disease and infection. If you get HPV, a weak immune system may not be able to get rid of it. 
                HPV vaccine
                If you are eligible, think about having the HPV vaccine. The vaccine helps protect against 7 in 10 cervical cancers.
                Read more about the HPV vaccine
                Try to have safer sex
                Using condoms or dental dams help reduce your risk of getting HPV, but they do not completely protect against it. Condoms and dental dams only cover part of the genitals, but HPV lives on the skin in and around the whole genital area. 
                How do I get rid of HPV?
                There is no treatment for HPV. Instead, your immune system will usually get rid of HPV before it causes any problems. In fact, 9 in 10 people get rid of HPV within 2 years.
                If you have HIV, your immune system may be less able to get rid of HPV. You can speak with your doctor about having cervical screening (a smear test) once a year. 
                Who did I get HPV from?
                You can have HPV for a long time without knowing about it, so it is difficult to know when you got HPV or who you got it from. 
                HPV in long-term relationships
                If you have been with a long-term partner, you may worry that having HPV means they have been unfaithful. This is not true. Although your immune system usually gets rid of HPV, it can sometimes stay in your body without causing any problems or being detected with a test. This is called dormant or clinically insignificant HPV. 
                Sometimes dormant HPV can become active again, which means it can be detected with a test and may start causing cervical cell changes. We don’t know why HPV becomes active again. 
                Because HPV can stay dormant in your body without being detected, it is possible that you got the virus many years – even decades – ago but never knew you had it.

                Most types of HPV do not cause cervical cancer. About 13 high-risk HPV types are linked to cancer, with high-risk types 16 and 18 causing most (over 70%) cervical cancers.
                Overall, nearly all cases of cervical cancer (99.7%) are caused by high-risk HPV.
                Will everyone with high-risk HPV get cervical cancer?
                No! During our lives, 4 out of 5 (80%) of us will get some type of HPV. Usually, our immune system gets rid of it without treatment. Most of us will never know we had it. Around 90% of HPV infections clear within 2 years.
                For a small number of women and people with a cervix, their immune system will not be able to get rid of HPV. This is called a persistent infection. A persistent HPV infection causes the cells of the cervix to change.  
                What happens if you get HPV?
                
                 
                 
                You get high-risk HPV through skin-to-skin genital contact. 
                The high-risk HPV attacks basal cells of the cervix. Basal cells are like building blocks that make up your skin. These cells are always making new cells (replicating). If they are infected with HPV and change (become abnormal), any new cells will also be abnormal.  
                If your immune system gets rid of HPV (9 in 10 people)
                
                 
                Your immune system is strong enough to fight the HPV infection. The cells get rid of the HPV, usually within 2 years.
                 
                 If your immune system can't get rid of HPV (1 in 10 people)
                
                Your immune system is not strong enough to fight the HPV infection. If this happens, the epithelial cells can become infected with HPV. Epithelial cells cover the outer surfaces of the body or body parts, such the part of the cervix where a sample is taken during cervical screening (a smear test). As these cells divide, they create more abnormal cells. Over time, these may develop into cervical cancer if not monitored or treated. 
                Remember, going for cervical screening (smear tests) means cell changes are found early, so most cell changes will not develop into cervical cancer.
                How do I reduce the risk of high-risk HPV developing into cancer?
                Going for cervical screening when invited is the best way to find cell changes early, so they can be monitored or treated as needed.
                Read more about cervical screening
                Why can’t everyone get rid of HPV?
                We don't know why some people can get rid of HPV, while others may develop cell changes and, possibly, cervical cancer. This is why going for cervical screening when you are invited is important, so it can find any changes to cells early.

                Does having HPV mean my partner has been unfaithful?
                HPV may stay in your body for a long time – sometimes decades – but be dormant or clinically insignificant, which means a test will not detect it. However, it can become active again so a test may then detect it, even if you’ve been with a partner for many years. Although the virus seems new because it’s the first time you have been aware of it, that doesn’t mean it actually is. So the short answer is having HPV while you have a long-term partner does not mean they have been unfaithful.
                If I haven’t had sex for a long time, could I still have HPV?
                It's possible. In most cases, your immune system will eventually get rid of an HPV infection within 2 years. But HPV can stay in our bodies – sometimes without us knowing about it, as it is not detected with a test. This is called dormant or clinically insignificant HPV. This HPV can become active again, for reasons we don’t know yet, and start to cause cervical cell changes. 
                I am LGBT+. Am I at risk of getting HPV?
                Anyone who has ever had any sexual contact is at risk of getting HPV. It doesn’t matter what kind of sex that is – penetrative, oral, touching or sharing sex toys – or who you have it with.
                Is sex the only way I could get HPV?
                Although HPV is usually passed on through sexual contact, we are still learning a lot about the virus. There is some evidence to suggest that, very rarely, HPV may be passed on in other ways, including vaginal childbirth.
                It is important to understand how small this risk is. Although it can happen, the evidence shows that affected babies cleared the infection within days or months, and none had any serious conditions as a result. 
                Thanks to the HPV vaccine, less women have the types of HPV that cause most cervical cancers and some other cancers, so the likelihood of pregnant women passing on HPV will become even smaller.

                We know the idea of passing on HPV in this way may be worrying, but all of the evidence suggests it is rare and, if it did happen, would not cause any harm. If you are very worried, your doctor or midwife would be the best people to speak with, as they know your full medical history and individual situation.
                If my partner or I have HPV, will we keep passing it between each other?
                Current evidence suggests that natural immunity to HPV, and going on to develop an immune response that would protect against reinfection, is poor, so there is a possibility that reinfection between couples could happen.
                Do I have to tell current or future partners that I have HPV?
                It is completely up to you.

                Cervical cancer isn’t the only cancer type linked to high-risk HPV. Worldwide, about 5% of all cancers are linked to the virus. Most are linked to high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 – the same types of HPV that cause 70% of all cervical cancers.
                
                
                If you have had high-grade cervical cell changes (abnormal cells) in the past, you have a higher risk of developing a different type of HPV-related change or cancer. This risk is small, but we know it can be worrying, so it may help to be aware of symptoms and speak with your doctor about any concerns.
                Other cancers linked to high-risk HPV
                Not every case of the cancers listed below is caused by high-risk HPV. But at least some cases are linked to the virus – usually HPV 16 or HPV 18.
                High-risk HPV and cancer in women
                Vaginal cancer
                
                
                Vulval cancer 
                High-risk HPV and cancer in men
                Penile cancer
                
                
                High-risk HPV and cancer in women and men
                Anal cancer 
                Some head and neck cancers, including:
                oropharyngeal cancer
                
                
                mouth cancer.
                 
                Changes to cells (abnormalities)
                Just like cervical cancer, vaginal, vulval, anal and penile cancer have precancerous stages – cell changes (abnormal cells) that can develop into cancer:
                Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) 
                Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) 
                Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) 
                Penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)
                Sometimes these cell changes go back to normal without treatment. If they do not and are left untreated, they may develop into cancer. This is why it's important to be aware of the symptoms.
                Symptoms of other cancers linked to high-risk HPV
                There are no screening programmes for these cell changes. This is because it is more difficult to find them than it is to find cervical cell changes. This can be worrying, so it is important to be aware of the symptoms for these cancers.
                For each cancer, look out for these symptoms in the relevant area:
                itching that does not stop (persistent itching)
                pain
                bleeding.
